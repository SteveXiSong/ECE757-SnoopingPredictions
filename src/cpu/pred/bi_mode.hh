/**
 * Implements a bi-mode branch predictor. The bi-mode predictor is a two-level
 * branch predictor that has three seprate history arrays: a taken array, a
 * not-taken array, and a choice array. The taken/not-taken arrays are indexed
 * by a hash of the PC and the global history. The choice array is indexed by
 * the PC only. Because the taken/not-taken arrays use the same index, they must
 * be the same size.
 *
 * The bi-mode branch predictor aims to eliminate the destructive aliasing that
 * occurs when two branches of opposite biases share the same global history
 * pattern. By separating the predictors into taken/not-taken arrays, and using
 * the branch's PC to choose between the two, destructive aliasing is reduced.
